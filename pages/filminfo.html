                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Dune is set in the far future, in a feudal interplanetary society ruled by numerous noble houses over planetary fiefs. 
                    It depicts the narrative of Paul Atreides, a young man whose family takes care of the planet Arrakis. 
                    While the planet is a desolate and thinly populated desert wasteland, it is the sole source of melange, or "spice," a medication that extends life and improves mental ability. 
                    Melange is also required for space navigation, which necessitates a level of multidimensional awareness and foresight that the drug alone can give. Because melange can only be created on Arrakis, dominion over the planet is both sought and perilous. 
                    As the empire's factions clash and oppose each other in a battle for control of Arrakis and its spice. The novel delves into the multifaceted interplay of politics, religion, environment, technology, and human emotion.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Novel adaptations to film have a reputation for being tough and intricate. Cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to produce a film based on the novel in the 1970s. 
                    The project was discontinued after three years of development due to an ever-increasing expenditure. In 1984, a film adaption directed by David Lynch was released to critical acclaim. 
                    The book was also turned into the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune in 2000, as well as its 2003 sequel <a href="#authorinbeddedlink" >Frank Herbert's</a> Children of Dune, which combined the events of two of the books. 
                    Denis Villeneuve's second film adaption, directed by him, was released on October 21, 2021, to generally good reviews from reviewers. The series has served as the inspiration for a number of board games, role-playing games, and video games.

                    Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr (October 8, 1920 – February 11, 1986) was an American science fiction novelist best known for his 1965 novel Dune and its five sequels. He was most known for his novels, although he also authored short stories and worked as a newspaper writer, photographer, book critic, ecological consultant, and speaker.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Dune saga, set in the distant future and spanning millennia, explores complex themes such as human evolution, planetary science and ecology, and the intersection of religion, politics, economics, and power in a future where humanity has long since developed interstellar travel and settled thousands of worlds. 
                    Dune is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and the entire trilogy is regarded as a genre masterpiece.
                    Herbert began his Dune study in 1959. 
                    Because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertisement writer for department shops in the 1960s, he was able to dedicate himself entirely to his literary profession. 
                    The novel Dune, which launched the Dune franchise, was released in 1965. He subsequently informed Willis E. McNelly that the work was inspired by a magazine article he was assigned to write on sand dunes at the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became overly interested and ended up with considerably more raw material than was required for the storey. 
                    The essay was never published, but it was the seed that grew into Dune. 
                    According to mycologist Paul Stamets's account, another key source of inspiration for Dune was his encounters with psilocybin and his passion of mushroom cultivation.
                    Dune took six years of research and writing to finish, making it far lengthier than most commercial science fiction of the period. 
                    Analog (the renamed Astounding, still edited by John W. Campbell) released it in two sections totaling eight pieces, "Dune World" in December 1963 and "Prophet of Dune" in 1965. [15] It was then turned down by over twenty book publishers.
                    Due to this Dune and the Dune saga are among the best-selling science fiction series and novels in the world; Dune in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Nebula Award in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is widely regarded as one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best. 
                    Locus readers voted it the finest SF novel of all time in 1975, again in 1987, and again in 1998.
